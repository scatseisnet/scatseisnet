"""Scattering network graph definition.

This module contains the :class:`~.ScatteringNetwork` class that implements the
scattering network graph. The network is composed of a series of wavelet filter
banks (so far limited to :class:`~.ComplexMorletBank` instances) and pooling
operations.

The :class:`~.ScatteringNetwork` class is a container for the filter banks and
the pooling operations. It is used to transform time samples (waveforms with an
artibtrary number of channels) with the scattering network graph. The
:class:`~.ScatteringNetwork` class is also used to compute the scattering
network graph properties, such as the number of output channels, the number of
output bins, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    layer_kwargs: :class:`dict`
        The keyword argiments of each filter bank keyword arguments, in the form
        of a :series of :class:`dict` objects with the keyword arguments for
        :class:`~.ComplexMorletBank`. The number of network layers is defined by
        the number of arguments. Please see the :class:`~.ComplexMorletBank`
        documentation for more information about the keyword arguments themselves.
    bins: :class:`int`, optional
        Number of time samples per signal windows. By default, this value is
        128. Note that once set, the value cannot be changed.
    sampling_rate: :class:`float`, optional
        Input data sampling rate in Hertz. This is useful to keep track of
        physical frequencies in the filterbanks properties. The default value is
        1.0 (reduced frequency).

    Attributes
    ----------
    banks: :class:`list` of :class:`~.ComplexMorletBank`
        Filter banks of the scattering network. The length of this list is equal
        to the number of layers of the scattering network. Each filter bank is
        an instance of the :class:`~.ComplexMorletBank` class.
    sampling_rate: float
        Input data sampling rate in Hertz.

        This function transforms a single segment with the scattering network.

        any pooling operation.

        Parameters
        ----------

            segment and ``n_channels`` is the number of channels. The number of
            channels can be 1 or more.
