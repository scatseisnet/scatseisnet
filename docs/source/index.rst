About
-----

The **scatseisnet** library contains programs to transform time series into scattering coefficients with a scattering network. The scattering network is a deep neural network with wavelet filters as convolutional layers. 

This package was written and documented by Léonard Seydoux and René Steinmann. The core of the package and docstrings was written by Léonard Seydoux, the documentation was generated using ReadTheDocs and the tutorials were written by René Steinmann and Léonard Seydoux. The tutorial notebooks are a simplified product of the papers published by René Steinmann. The repository is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/scatseisnet/scatseisnet>`_ and the documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://scatseisnet.readthedocs.io>`_.

This work was supported by the `European Advanced Grant F-IMAGE <https://f-image.osug.fr/?lang=en>`_ (ERC PE10, ERC-2016-ADG) and by the `Multidisciplinary Institute of Artificial Intelligence <https://miai.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/>`_ (MIAI) at the University of Grenoble Alpes. If you use this package for your own scientific output, please cite one or more of the papers mentionned in the References section below.

.. important::

   This project is still in development. The API is not stable and may change
   without notice. Once a stable version is released, the API will be
   considered stable and will not change without a major version bump.
   A target release date will be around April 2023.

Installation
------------

The package is available from the PyPI repository. To install using pip, execute the following line:


.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: CPU-only installation

   pip install scatseisnet

If you want to use a GPU, you need to install the package with the package CuPy. The code will try to find it and use it if it is installed. You can install it with the following command.

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: GPU usage

   pip install cupy
