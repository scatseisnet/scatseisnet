## Test Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Run tests before each commit
- Review coverage reports monthly
- Update tests when adding features
- Keep test dependencies up to date
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline health

### On New Python Release
1. Add Python version to CI matrix
2. Update pyproject.toml classifiers
3. Test with new Python version locally
4. Update dependency versions if needed
5. Run full test suite
6. Update documentation

## Notes

- All tests are written using Python's unittest framework
- Tests are compatible with pytest for advanced features
- Coverage reports are generated in `htmlcov/` directory
- Test configuration in `setup.cfg`
- Tox configuration in `tox.ini` for multi-version testing
